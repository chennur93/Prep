/**
 * You are given two integers, n and k. Consider the string representation of n and find the number of distinct substrings of length k
 * such that n is divisible by the number formed by that substring. In other words, how many different numbers formed by k consecutive digits
 * of n are factors of n ?
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. n = 120, k = 2; Possible substring of size 2 are 12, 20. And both are divisors of 120 so ans = 2;
 * 2. n = 555, k = 1; Possible substring of size 1 is 5. And its a divisor of 555 so ans = 1; Note: 3 is also a 1-digit divisor but not a substring of the given string.
 * 3. n = 5341, k = 2; Possible substring of size 2 are 53, 34, 41. Neither are divisors of 5341 so ans = 0;
